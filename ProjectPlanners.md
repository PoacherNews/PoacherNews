### Game Ideas. By Kirtis
* What if Risk had a baby with Mario Kart?
  - Risk but like theres powerups (Nukes, etc) but some are good but some are bad
* Shitty top-down "Dead Ops Arcade" clone
  - Top down shooter, endless waves, random powerups, levels with different maps?
* Ever play the Trials ripoff from Thrillville? Yeah lets make that
  - 2D motorcycle game, with backflips
* Adventure from the Atari 2600
  - The top down shooter but without the shooter and with no idea what you're doing
* Snake should be easy to make right?

* All of these could have online leaderboards via MySQL on my AWS server

### Ideas by Colin
* Boredom Eliminator
  - Optionally allows you to enter things you *dont* like doing, or what your budget is.
  - Selects a place/thing/event within some radius, but doesn't tell the user what it has selected.
  - Automatically starts GPS navigation with the place as the destination. Only tells the user what they're there for once they arrive.
  - Based on user feedback (the app user and all other users), as well as reviews, etc. determines what locations to better select in the future.
  - Can be paired with a friend in their version of the app so you both go to the same destination.

* Uber Shipping
   - If you have a large car, you can sign up to deliver packages, items, etc. around your city.
   - Like Uber, drivers work whenever they want and any available drivers can accept the job.
   - Allows people to move stuff around their city same-day and cheaper than shipping through a carrier like UPS/Fedex.
   - Insurance issues?
