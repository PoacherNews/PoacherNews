### Game Ideas. By Kirtis
* What if Risk had a baby with Mario Kart?
  - Risk but like theres powerups (Nukes, etc) but some are good but some are bad
* Shitty top-down "Dead Ops Arcade" clone
  - Top down shooter, endless waves, random powerups, levels with different maps?
* Ever play the Trials ripoff from Thrillville? Yeah lets make that
  - 2D motorcycle game, with backflips
* Adventure from the Atari 2600
  - The top down shooter but without the shooter and with no idea what you're doing
* Snake should be easy to make right?

* All of these could have online leaderboards via MySQL on my AWS server
